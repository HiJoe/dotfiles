Here are a few things to check:\n\n1. Make sure your .env file is named correctly and located in the root directory:\n```\n.env\n```\n\n2. Verify the API key variable name in your .env file is correct:\n```\nVITE_EDAMAM_APP_KEY=your_api_key_here\n```\n\n3. Check how you're accessing the API key in your code:\n```javascript\nconst apiKey = import.meta.env.VITE_EDAMAM_APP_KEY\n```\n\n4. Ensure you're actually passing the API key in your API request headers:\n```javascript\nheaders: {\n  'x-api-key': apiKey\n}\n```\n\n5. Restart your development server after making changes to the .env file\n\n6. Double-check that the API key hasn't expired and is valid\n\nCan you share the relevant code where you're making the API request? That would help identify where the issue might be.\n\nAlso, if you're using Vite, remember that environment variables need to be prefixed with `VITE_` to be exposed to your client-side code.\n```js ChefClaude/ai.js\nimport Anthropic from \"@anthropic-ai/sdk\";\n\nconst SYSTEM_PROMPT = `You are an assistant that receives a list of ingredients that a user has and suggests a recipe they could make with some or all of those ingredients. You don't need to use every ingredient they mention in your recipe. The recipe can include additional ingredients they didn't mention, but try not to include too many extra ingredients. Format your response in markdown to make it easier to render to a web page`;\n\nconst anthropic = new Anthropic({\n  apiKey: \"process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\",\n  dangerouslyAllowBrowser: true,\n});\n\nexport async function getRecipeFromChefClaude(ingredientsArr) {\n  const ingredientString = ingredientsArr.join(\", \");\n\n  const msg = await anthropic.messages.create({\n    model: \"claude-3-haiku-20240307\",\n    max_tokens: 1024,\n    system: SYSTEM_PROMPT,\n    messages: [\n      {\n        role: \"user\",\n        content: `I have ${ingredientString}.  Please give me a recipe you'd recommend I make!`,\n      },\n    ],\n  });\n  return msg.content[0].text;\n}\n```\n\n\nthis is the file \n\nI see the issue. In your code, you're passing the API key as a string literal `\"process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\"` instead of actually accessing the environment variable. Here's how to fix it:\n\n```js\nconst anthropic = new Anthropic({\n  apiKey: process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY,  // Remove the quotes\n  dangerouslyAllowBrowser: true,\n});\n```\n\nAlso, since you're using Vite, you'll need to access environment variables using `import.meta.env` instead of `process.env`. So the correct way would be:\n\n```js\nconst anthropic = new Anthropic({\n  apiKey: import.meta.env.VITE_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY,\n  dangerouslyAllowBrowser: true,\n});\n```\n\nMake sure your .env file has the variable defined like this:\n```\nVITE_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-actual-api-key-here\n```\n\nRemember:\n1. The environment variable must be prefixed with `VITE_` to be accessible in the client-side code\n2. After making changes to the .env file, restart your development server\n3. Never commit your .env file to version control\nI use bun instead of node\n\nAh, if you're using Bun, you can access environment variables using `process.env` directly. Here's the corrected code:\n\n```js\nconst anthropic = new Anthropic({\n  apiKey: process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY,  // Remove the quotes\n  dangerouslyAllowBrowser: true,\n});\n```\n\nAnd in your `.env` file, you can define the variable without the `VITE_` prefix:\n```\nANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-actual-api-key-here\n```\n\nIf you're still getting the authentication error, make sure:\n1. Your `.env` file is in the root directory of your project\n2. The API key value in your `.env` file is correct and not expired\n3. You've restarted your Bun server after making changes to the `.env` file\n4. You've installed and imported any necessary environment variable handling packages if required\n\nYou might also want to add a console.log to verify the API key is being read correctly:\n```js\nconsole.log('API Key:', process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY);  // Make sure to remove this before production!\n```\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":138}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":21},"start":213,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":139}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":22},"start":1224,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":140}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":53},"start":2300,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":141}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":74},"start":2319,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":142}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":75},"start":3293,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":143}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":119},"start":3320,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":144}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":120},"start":4285,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":145}}}],"summary":"API Authentication Error Fix","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null},{"range":{"start":1224,"end":2298},"icon":"File","label":"ChefClaude/ai.js","metadata":{"path":"ChefClaude/ai.js"}}]}
