Here are a few things to check:\n\n1. Make sure your .env file is named correctly and located in the root directory:\n```\n.env\n```\n\n2. Verify the API key variable name in your .env file is correct:\n```\nVITE_EDAMAM_APP_KEY=your_api_key_here\n```\n\n3. Check how you're accessing the API key in your code:\n```javascript\nconst apiKey = import.meta.env.VITE_EDAMAM_APP_KEY\n```\n\n4. Ensure you're actually passing the API key in your API request headers:\n```javascript\nheaders: {\n  'x-api-key': apiKey\n}\n```\n\n5. Restart your development server after making changes to the .env file\n\n6. Double-check that the API key hasn't expired and is valid\n\nCan you share the relevant code where you're making the API request? That would help identify where the issue might be.\n\nAlso, if you're using Vite, remember that environment variables need to be prefixed with `VITE_` to be exposed to your client-side code.\n```js ChefClaude/ai.js\nimport Anthropic from \"@anthropic-ai/sdk\";\n\nconst SYSTEM_PROMPT = `You are an assistant that receives a list of ingredients that a user has and suggests a recipe they could make with some or all of those ingredients.
